# Get-Instagram-Account-Details-using-Python
# Introduction :
Hello Curious Coders,

In this Project we are going to fetch the details of an Instagram Account. There is pre defined package in python named instaloader which is going to allow us to scrape through the instagram account of someone. Let’s get into it…..

# Code Explanation :
Initially installed the instaloader package from cmd using command“pip install instaloader” 
We imported the required package instaloader
Next we created an instaloader object
Later we acquired username from the user using input() function
Then we fetched all the details of the instagram user using Profile.from_username() method of instaloader package.
Finally displayed all the fetched results on to the console.

# Output:

Hence the insta details of that username are displayed on the screen
